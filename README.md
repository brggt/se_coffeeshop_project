# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project has taught me a lot, in the future I would like to be better at anchoring items, for example the image on the header page & the videos come outside of their container. I would be able to figure this out by playing with it but I would like to see the progress I will be making by having this as something to look back at. I would definitely add more animations & different styles.
